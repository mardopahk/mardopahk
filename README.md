- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mardo
- ğŸ‘€ I like to write tests (unit, integration), so that when people ask me "does it work" I can say "Yes, it works" ğŸ˜„
- ğŸ“ˆ What I do: deployment/build automation with scripts, development (C#, .NET, Vue.js), lead (and motivate) teams and overall try to improve any product I put my hands on.
